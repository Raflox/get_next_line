This is a C function that reads a line from a file descriptor. 
The function uses a static buffer (stash) to temporarily store data read from the file descriptor. 
The function starts by checking if the file descriptor is valid and 
if the buffer size is greater than 0. 
If the file descriptor is invalid or the buffer size is less than 1, 
the function will return NULL.

The function then initializes a variable "line" as NULL and enters a while loop. 
The loop continues until there is data in the stash buffer or data is read from 
the file descriptor using the read function. 
The function then calls ft_join, which takes the current line and the stash buffer as input, 
concatenates them and returns the result.

The function then calls ft_nextclean, which cleans up the stash buffer by 
moving characters after the newline to the beginning of the buffer, 
and setting all previous characters to '\0'.
The function returns the line if it finds a newline character in the stash buffer. 
If the file descriptor has no more data to read, the function returns the last line read.
